transfered code from last year to here

i think i found out how to connect and try to use sensors as well i just need to find out a bit more about them

the color sensor isn't working (it isn't showing up in the driverhub robot management thing) so i couldn't configure that.

also, the password to the old robot is arex7989 and that one code thing we used last year is called http://192.168.43.1:8080/

that is also where i tried to use the touch sensor.
