This is now public and stuff. Has some basic code that is mainly used for team 7989 and its fairly simple. For those on our team, in the overall config file, you can either use AI to quickly make a mock program (please be very specific or you might break components on the robot) and be sure to proof read the code and remodel it since.. as it may run, it might not be very readable to you so try not to just full on copy and paste stuff. If there are any hardware issues, you might need to check the configuration on the drivers hub. On the programming computer is the password for the robot as well inside of the 24-25 seasons meetingLog text file.

the files and github has been revamped

keeping this here for first time memories stuff (first time we've used github right now)

when making a new repository use FTC_[year1here]to[year2here]
put the psudocode (if any), autonomous and driver period code in it
describe the robots NEW functions in the description of the overall repository
if you check notepad on the main computer, you'll see notes on prior years and meetings that may help you grasp the code easier

transfered code from last year to here

i think i found out how to connect and try to use sensors as well i just need to find out a bit more about them

the color sensor isn't working (it isn't showing up in the driverhub robot management thing) so i couldn't configure that.

also, the password to the old robot is arex7989 and that one code thing we used last year is called http://192.168.43.1:8080/

that is also where i tried to use the touch sensor.
